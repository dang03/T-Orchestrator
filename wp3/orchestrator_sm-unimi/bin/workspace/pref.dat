# PREFERENCE DATASET
# This dataset contains varibles and parameters which are not strictly related to 
# NI or NS requirements / constraints, but they set the solver behavior as specified by
# user requirements (i.e. fixed geographical location of PoP) or NI status (i.e. 
# aggregating all the VNF into one single PoP, instead of spreading them in 
# different locations)

data;

# Weight of the objective function
# alpha: by increasing alpha, the solver optimizes the allocation of the VNFs by keeping
# the allocation cost at minimum
# beta: by increasing beta, the solver optimizes the allocation of VNFs so that the 
# aggregate delay is at minimum
# gamma: by increasing gamma, the solver optimizes the allocation of VNFs by maximizing the
# aggregation of VNF per PoP (negative values of gamma actually increase the spreading)
param alpha := 0.0;
param beta := 0.0;
param gamma := -1.0;
